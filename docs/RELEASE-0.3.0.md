# Creator Project Setup 0.3.0

The coordinated Windows release with Creator Hub 0.1.0 and Creator Works MCP 2.7.0.
Use Project Setup inside Hub or independently with the installer or portable ZIP.

## Setup And Recovery

- **Set up and create project** checks requirements, previews the downloads and
  installs missing supported tools after your licence and installation approval.
- Pinned recipe: Unity 6000.3.21f1, Creator SDK 4.0.14, URP 17.3.0 and Input 1.20.0.
  Android SDK/NDK/OpenJDK and Windows build support are required.
- Package import/compilation, Visual Scripting configuration and a second Unity
  validation session are separate visible progress stages.
- Download size, received bytes and speed are shown when measurable. Installed
  requirements are refreshed instead of retaining a stale Missing label.
- Failures show the actual error, recovery guidance and local report paths.
  Failed project folders are preserved; logs are never uploaded automatically.
- Existing-project inspection and reviewed, backed-up repairs remain available.

## Creator Plugins

The built-in catalogue includes images, descriptions, credit and category filters.
Add its Editor-only menu to a selected project, or queue eligible packages for
Unity's import selection. The menu supports thumbnail cards, direct Import and
Cancel/retry without reopening. Known old helpers update with a retained backup;
unknown edits are preserved. MCP tools and AI skills have their own categories,
without automatic AI-client configuration.

## Important Limits

Windows x64. Unity sign-in/licence activation and administrator prompts still need
the user; this app cannot bypass them. An old Unity Hub is not silently upgraded.
Automatic Hub project registration requires Hub 3.21.1 or newer and may need an
approved restart. macOS/Linux automatic prerequisite installation is not available.

Windows binaries are not Authenticode signed. Signed Hub download metadata is a
separate integrity check. Attached acceptance reports identify the exact release
artifacts and tested upgrades; they do not prove every previous installation,
every project, player builds, hosted spaces or headset behavior. Review package
file selections and logs before importing or sharing them.
